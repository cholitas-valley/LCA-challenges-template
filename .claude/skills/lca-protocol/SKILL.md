## runs/state.json schema
```json

follow_roles: []            # optional: list of agent names to additionally obey
post: []                    # optional: list of agent names to run after role succeeds
depends_on: []              # optional
inputs:
  - objective.md
  - runs/plan.md
  - runs/handoffs/task-000.md
allowed_paths:
