**Decision:** WARNING (proceed)

**Summary:**
- Lines changed (919) slightly exceeds threshold - mostly logging files
- Permission prompts (4) exceeded threshold - planning clarifications, not security
- Token consumption 17.9M across 8 completed tasks (task-026 through task-034)
- Good progress on Feature 3: structured logging, migrations, Docker prod, ESP32

**Action:** Continuing with task-035 (ESP32 Sensors and MQTT with TLS)
