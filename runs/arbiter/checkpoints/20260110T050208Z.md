# Arbiter Checkpoint Report

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-10T05:02:08Z
**Trigger:** Token threshold (956K tokens since last checkpoint)
**Hook Event:** SubagentStop
**Phase:** BETWEEN_TASKS (post-planning)

---

## Summary

Planning phase completed for run/006 (Feature 5: Designer Space). The orchestrator generated 6 new tasks (task-048 through task-053) for implementing the visual floor plan feature. All changes are confined to planning artifacts - no code modifications during planning phase.

---

## Token Usage

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tokens since last checkpoint | 956,092 |
| Total tokens this run | 40,377,940 |
| Tool invocations | 33 |

**Assessment:** Token usage is elevated (956K) but reasonable for a planning phase that involved analyzing objective.md, generating 6 task files, updating plan.md, and handling user interaction for Feature 5 direction.

## Diff Statistics

| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Files changed | 7 | 25 | OK (28%) |
| Lines added | 195 | 800 | OK (24%) |
| Lines removed | 199 | 800 | OK (25%) |

**Files modified (all planning artifacts):**
- `runs/plan.md` - Updated for Feature 5 (159 added, 180 removed)
- `runs/state.json` - State update (3 added, 3 removed)
- `runs/sessions/*.md` - Session tracking
- `runs/tools/usage.jsonl` - Tool usage log
- `runs/usage/usage.jsonl` - Token usage log

**New files created:**
- `runs/tasks/task-048.md` - Backend: Position Column + API
- `runs/tasks/task-049.md` - Frontend: SVG Plant Icon Library
- `runs/tasks/task-050.md` - Frontend: DesignerCanvas Component
- `runs/tasks/task-051.md` - Frontend: Status Overlays + Tooltips
- `runs/tasks/task-052.md` - Frontend: Designer Page with Sidebar
- `runs/tasks/task-053.md` - QA: Feature 5 Final Validation

## Permission Prompts

| Count | Threshold | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 2 | 3 | OK |

**Prompts:**
1. AskUserQuestion - Feature 5 direction (Real-time WebSockets vs Historical Analytics vs Automation Rules vs Multi-user Auth)
2. Notification - User attention needed

**Assessment:** Permission prompts were appropriate for gathering user input on Feature 5 scope.

---

## Task Progress

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current task | task-048 |
| Completed since last checkpoint | 0 |
| Tasks since last checkpoint | -10 (planning reset) |

**Assessment:** Zero completed tasks is expected - this checkpoint covers planning phase only. The orchestrator correctly generated tasks but has not yet begun execution. The -10 delta indicates transition from previous run's task numbering to new Feature 5 task sequence.

---

## Alignment with Objective

**Current state (from runs/state.json):**
- Phase: BETWEEN_TASKS
- Current task: task-048 (Backend: Position Column + API)
- Last handoff: runs/handoffs/task-047-gitops.md (from Feature 4)

**Feature 5 requirements from objective.md:**
- Plant Icon Library (20 SVG icons)
- DesignerCanvas component
- Status overlays with tooltips
- Position storage backend
- /designer page route

**Task alignment review:**
| Objective Requirement | Task | Aligned |
|-----------------------|------|---------|
| Position storage backend | task-048 | YES |
| 20 SVG plant icons | task-049 | YES |
| DesignerCanvas component | task-050 | YES |
| Status overlays + tooltips | task-051 | YES |
| Designer page with sidebar | task-052 | YES |
| QA validation | task-053 | YES |

**Assessment:** All tasks align with Feature 5 Definition of Done in objective.md.

---

## Concerns

None. This is a routine planning checkpoint with:
- All changes confined to `runs/` directory (planning artifacts)
- No source code modifications
- Task files properly structured with YAML frontmatter
- Clear Definition of Done in each task
- Appropriate permission prompts for user input

---

## Decision

**Severity:** INFO
**Needs Human:** No
**Action:** Continue to task execution
