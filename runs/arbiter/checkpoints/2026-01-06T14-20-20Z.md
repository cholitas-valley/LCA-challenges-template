# Arbiter Checkpoint Report

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-06T14:20:20Z  
**Run Branch:** run/001  
**Phase:** BETWEEN_TASKS  
**Current Task:** task-001 (not yet started)  
**Completed Tasks:** 0

---

## Executive Summary

This is the initial checkpoint following the boot and planning phase. The lca-planner agent successfully created the run infrastructure, generated a comprehensive execution plan, and defined three initial tasks. No implementation code has been written yet.

**Recommendation:** Proceed without human intervention.

---

## Token Analysis

**Tokens consumed:** 109,727  
**Tokens since last checkpoint:** 109,727 (first checkpoint)  
**Time elapsed:** 29,461,818 minutes (timing anomaly in data)

**Assessment:** Token usage is appropriate for the planning phase. The planner:
- Analyzed the challenge requirements
- Read existing architecture documentation
- Generated a detailed run plan with 5 phases
- Created 3 initial task files with proper YAML frontmatter and detailed specifications

**Risk Level:** LOW - Planning phase token consumption is expected and proportional to output quality.

## Code Change Analysis

**Files changed:** 0  
**Lines added:** 0  
**Lines removed:** 0  
**Git status:** 6 untracked files in runs/ directory

**Git working tree status:**
```
?? runs/arbiter/pending.json
?? runs/plan.md
?? runs/state.json
?? runs/tasks/
?? runs/tools/
?? runs/usage/
```

**Assessment:** No implementation code modified. All changes are protocol metadata files under runs/, which is expected and allowed for the planner agent. The repository state is clean (HEAD at ba34c53).

**Risk Level:** NONE - No implementation code touched.

---

## Diff Metrics vs. Thresholds

| Metric | Current | Threshold | Status |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Files changed | 0 | 25 | PASS |
| Lines changed | 0 | 800 | PASS |
| Permission prompts | 0 | 3 | PASS |

All metrics are well within acceptable ranges.

---

## Tool Invocations

**Total since last checkpoint:** 5 bash commands

**Tool usage breakdown:**
1. `git branch --show-current` - Check current branch
2. `ls -la` - Verify directory structure
3. `git branch -a | grep "run/" | sort -V | tail -1` - Find next run number
4. `git checkout -b run/001` - Create run branch
5. `mkdir -p runs/tasks runs/handoffs` - Create required directories

**Assessment:** All tool invocations were read-only or setup operations. No destructive commands. Appropriate for boot phase.

**Risk Level:** NONE

---

## Permission Requests

**Count:** 0  
**Assessment:** No elevated permissions requested.

---

## Plan Quality Assessment

**Plan location:** `/home/genge/dev-ash/foundry-nodevenv/cholitas/challenge-001-plantops/runs/plan.md`

**Plan includes:**
- Clear objective statement aligned with challenge requirements
- Architecture overview with 6 components (MQTT, Simulator, Backend, Database, Worker, Frontend)
- Data flow diagram
- Technology stack decisions with justifications
- 5 identified risks with mitigation strategies
- Rolling plan with 16 tasks across 5 phases
- Definition of done with 12 concrete checklist items

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive risk analysis (out-of-order telemetry, alert spam, rate limits, crash handling, polling overhead)
- Appropriate technology choices (TimescaleDB for time-series, Docker Compose for orchestration)
- Clear phase structure from infrastructure to testing
- Concrete acceptance criteria

**Concerns:** None identified.

---

## Task File Analysis

**Tasks created:** 3 (task-001, task-002, task-003)

**task-001:** Project scaffolding and infrastructure setup
- Role: lca-backend
- Post: lca-docs
- Scope: Makefile, docker-compose.yml, .env.example
- Check command: make lint
- Well-defined DoD with 7 checkpoints

**task-002:** Database schema and TimescaleDB setup
- Role: lca-backend
- Post: lca-docs
- Depends on: task-001
- Scope: Migrations, DB client, seed data for 6 plants
- Check command: make check
- Well-defined DoD with 7 checkpoints

**task-003:** MQTT broker and simulator implementation
- Role: lca-backend
- Post: lca-docs
- Depends on: task-001
- Scope: Mosquitto config, simulator with telemetry generation
- Check command: make check
- Well-defined DoD with 9 checkpoints

**Assessment:** All task files follow the required YAML frontmatter format. Tasks are appropriately scoped, have clear dependencies, and include concrete verification criteria.

---

## Alignment with Objective

**Objective:** Build a self-hosted plant monitoring system with MQTT ingestion, TimescaleDB storage, dashboard, and Discord alerts.

**Plan alignment:** EXCELLENT
- All core requirements addressed (MQTT, TimescaleDB, REST API, Dashboard, Discord)
- Phased approach reduces integration risk
- Docker-based deployment matches "one-command setup" requirement
- Quality gates (lint, typecheck, test, e2e) align with challenge scoring criteria

**Trajectory:** The plan provides a clear path from infrastructure to feature completion. No apparent drift or misalignment.

---

## Protocol Compliance

**State file:** `/home/genge/dev-ash/foundry-nodevenv/cholitas/challenge-001-plantops/runs/state.json`

```json
{
  "protocol": "lca-v1",
  "run_branch": "run/001",
  "phase": "BETWEEN_TASKS",
  "current_task_id": "task-001",
  "current_role": null,
  "completed_task_ids": [],
  "last_handoff": null,
  "updated_at": "2026-01-06T15:20:00Z"
}
```

**Assessment:** State file conforms to LCA protocol schema. Phase correctly set to BETWEEN_TASKS after planning completion.

---

## Decision Criteria Evaluation

### 1. Token burn vs. progress
**Status:** PASS  
Planning produced tangible artifacts (plan + 3 tasks). Token usage justified.

### 2. Diff magnitude
**Status:** PASS  
No implementation code changed. Only protocol files under runs/.

### 3. Permission prompts
**Status:** PASS  
Zero permission requests.

### 4. Objective alignment
**Status:** PASS  
Plan is well-aligned with challenge requirements. No drift detected.

## Recommended Actions

**Needs human review:** NO

**Reasons:**
1. This is the expected boot/planning checkpoint
2. No implementation code has been written yet
3. Token usage is proportional to planning output
4. All generated artifacts (plan, tasks, state) are properly formatted
5. No high-risk operations performed
6. Clear path to execution established

**Suggested user actions:** None required. Run should proceed to task-001 execution.

**Next steps:**
1. Orchestrator will advance to IN_TASK phase
2. lca-backend agent will be invoked for task-001
3. Next checkpoint will occur after task completion or threshold breach
