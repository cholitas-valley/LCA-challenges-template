## Progress Review

- **Last checkpoint tasks:** 9
- **Current completed tasks:** 12
- **Tasks completed this period:** 3
- **Phase:** PLANNING
- **Branch:** run/005 (state.json), run/004 (pending.json - stale reference)

The run transitioned from run/004 to run/005 branch. The pending.json reflects the older branch but state.json is current.

---

## Concerns

**None.** All metrics are healthy:
- Tasks progressing normally
- Diff size well below thresholds
- No permission escalations
- No dangerous commands detected

---

## Objective Alignment

Objective: Feature 4 UI/UX Refactor (frontend design cleanup)

The current phase is PLANNING which aligns with objective progression. Feature 4 focuses on frontend design improvements (semantic colors, component patterns, accessibility).

---

## Recommendation

Continue execution. No human intervention required.
