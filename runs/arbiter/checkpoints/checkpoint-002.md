# Arbiter Checkpoint 002

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-07T20:49:23Z  
**Trigger:** Time-based checkpoint (stale pending file)  
**Branch:** run/003  
**Phase:** BETWEEN_TASKS (task-001 completed, task-002 pending)

## Summary

Routine checkpoint after successful completion of task-001 (Project Scaffolding). The pending.json was stale - it reported 0 completed tasks but task-001 has since been completed and committed (d8a6945). This checkpoint confirms healthy progress.

Task-001 created the foundational PlantOps infrastructure:
- Docker Compose with PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB, Mosquitto MQTT, FastAPI backend
- Makefile with development workflow commands
- Backend Python skeleton with health endpoint
- Mosquitto configuration with password auth

## Token Usage

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total tokens | 195,566 |
| Tokens since last checkpoint | 28,620 |
| Last checkpoint tokens | 166,946 |
| Tasks completed this session | 1 (task-001) |
| Tokens per task | ~28,620 |

Token usage is reasonable for completing a scaffolding task with review and gitops.

## Diff Statistics (Uncommitted)

| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Files changed | 3 | 25 | OK (12%) |
| Lines added | 15 | 800 | OK (<2%) |
| Lines removed | 6 | 800 | OK (<1%) |

Uncommitted changes are only protocol artifacts:
- `runs/state.json` - state tracking updates
- `runs/tools/usage.jsonl` - tool invocation log
- `runs/usage/usage.jsonl` - token usage log
- `runs/handoffs/task-001-gitops.md` - gitops handoff (untracked)

## Committed Changes (task-001)

Task-001 commit (d8a6945) included 48 files:
- Infrastructure: docker-compose.yml, Makefile, .env.example, .gitignore
- Backend: Dockerfile, pyproject.toml, src/main.py, tests/test_health.py
- Mosquitto: mosquitto.conf, passwd
- Protocol: plan.md, state.json, task files, handoffs

All changes align with objective.md Feature 1 (Core Platform) requirements.

## Tool Invocations

59 tool invocations reviewed since session start. Key operations:
- Branch creation: `git checkout -b run/003`
- Directory setup: `mkdir -p runs/tasks runs/handoffs`
- File creation: docker-compose.yml, Makefile, backend files, mosquitto config
- Verification: `docker compose config --quiet`, `make help`
- Git operations: `git add -A`, `git commit`

No high-risk commands detected. All commands are standard development operations.

## Permission Prompts

0 permission prompts since last checkpoint. Within threshold (3).

## Objective Alignment

Task-001 "Project scaffolding" directly supports objective.md goals:
- Docker services set up for PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB (telemetry storage)
- Mosquitto configured for MQTT device communication
- FastAPI backend skeleton ready for device provisioning API
- Infrastructure ready for Feature 1 (Core Platform) implementation

Progress is on track.

## Concerns

None. This is a routine post-task checkpoint confirming healthy progress.

## Decision

**Severity:** INFO  
**Needs Human:** No  
**Action:** Continue to task-002 (Database Schema)
