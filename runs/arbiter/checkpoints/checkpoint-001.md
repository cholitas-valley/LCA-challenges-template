# Arbiter Checkpoint 001

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-07T19:12:13Z  
**Trigger:** Token threshold (166,946 tokens)  
**Branch:** run/003  
**Phase:** Post-planning, before task-001

## Summary

Planning phase completed successfully. The lca-planner generated 25 task files covering the PlantOps IoT plant monitoring system with LLM care advisor feature.

This is a routine checkpoint triggered by token usage during planning. No implementation code has been written yet.

## Token Usage

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total tokens | 166,946 |
| Tokens since last checkpoint | 166,946 |
| Tasks completed | 0 |
| Tasks generated | 25 |

Token burn is reasonable for generating a comprehensive 25-task plan covering:
- Device provisioning with MQTT auth
- Plant management CRUD
- Telemetry pipeline with TimescaleDB
- Frontend dashboard
- LLM care advisor integration

## Diff Statistics

| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Files changed | 0 | 25 | OK |
| Lines added | 0 | 800 | OK |
| Lines removed | 0 | 800 | OK |

All changes are untracked files in `runs/` directory (protocol artifacts only):
- runs/plan.md
- runs/state.json
- runs/tasks/ (25 task files)
- runs/arbiter/pending.json

## Tool Invocations

6 tool invocations reviewed - all benign setup commands:
1. `git branch --show-current` - check branch
2. `ls runs/` - check directory state
3. `ls runs/tasks/` - check tasks directory
4. `git branch -a | grep run/` - list run branches
5. `git checkout -b run/003` - create run branch
6. `mkdir -p runs/tasks runs/handoffs` - create directories

No high-risk commands detected.

## Permission Prompts

0 permission prompts since last checkpoint. Within threshold (3).

## Concerns

None. This is a routine post-planning checkpoint.

## Decision

**Severity:** INFO  
**Needs Human:** No  
**Action:** Continue to task-001 execution
