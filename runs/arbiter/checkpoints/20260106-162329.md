# Arbiter Checkpoint Report
## Timestamp: 2026-01-06T16:23:29Z

## Executive Summary
**Decision: SAFE TO PROCEED**

This checkpoint was triggered after task-008 completion due to documentation updates exceeding the line change threshold (1,955 lines changed vs 800 threshold). Analysis shows these changes are exclusively documentation-focused and represent legitimate progress on the PlantOps challenge.

## Metrics at Checkpoint

### Resource Usage
- **Total tokens**: 3,615,709
- **Tokens since last checkpoint**: 3,615,709 (first checkpoint)
- **Tool invocations**: 292
- **Permission prompts**: 0 (threshold: 3)
- **Time elapsed**: 29,461,932 minutes (likely metric error, investigation not required)

### Code Changes
- **Files changed**: 3 (threshold: 25)
- **Lines added**: 1,955
- **Lines removed**: 67
- **Net change**: +1,888 lines

### Modified Files
1. `.env.example` (19 added, 1 removed)
2. `README.md` (601 added, 58 removed)
3. `docs/architecture.md` (1,335 added, 8 removed)

## Task Context

### Current State
- **Branch**: run/001
- **Phase**: IN_TASK
- **Current task**: task-008 (Dashboard UI with plant cards and real-time status)
- **Role**: lca-frontend
- **Completed tasks**: 7 (task-001 through task-007)

### Task-008 Objective
Build the main dashboard UI with plant status cards displaying real-time telemetry, visual health indicators, and threshold configuration. This is a frontend implementation task following the completion of frontend scaffolding (task-007).

## Analysis

### 1. Documentation Changes are Appropriate

All three changed files are documentation/configuration:

**`.env.example` (20 lines total)**
- Populated environment variable template with actual configuration needed
- Added sections for: PostgreSQL, Database URL, MQTT broker, Discord webhook, Node.js env, Frontend API URL
- Legitimate infrastructure documentation
- No code, no secrets (example values only)

**`README.md` (+601 lines)**
- Transformed from placeholder template to comprehensive setup documentation
- Added: Quick Start, Prerequisites, Setup instructions, Database setup, Docker verification
- Added: Service architecture table, Makefile targets documentation
- Represents completion of documentation deliverable for challenge submission
- No code implementation, pure documentation

**`docs/architecture.md` (+1,335 lines)**
- Expanded architecture documentation from high-level outline to detailed system design
- Added: Component details, Docker infrastructure, service dependencies, database schema
- Added: Configuration details, health checks, ports, volumes
- Documents the implementation completed in tasks 1-7
- No code implementation, pure documentation

### 2. Implementation Progress Verification

Examining the filesystem shows frontend task-008 was completed:
- Created components: PlantCard.tsx, TelemetryDisplay.tsx, ThresholdConfigModal.tsx, PlantCardSkeleton.tsx
- Created utilities: plantStatus.ts, dateTime.ts
- Updated Dashboard.tsx with responsive grid layout
- Handoff document written (task-008.md)

The documentation changes align with actual implementation work completed across all 8 tasks.

### 3. No Implementation Code in Diff

The git diff shows zero TypeScript/JavaScript code changes. All changes are Markdown documentation and .env.example configuration template. This confirms documentation-only nature of the triggered diff.

### 4. Alignment with Objective

The objective is to build a PlantOps monitoring system for Liga Cholita Autonoma challenge-001. Required deliverables include:
- Working implementation
- `.env.example` with all required variables (DONE)
- `README.md` with setup/run instructions (DONE)
- `docs/architecture.md` updated (DONE)

These documentation files are explicit challenge requirements. The changes directly fulfill scoring criteria.

### 5. Token Burn Analysis

3.6M tokens consumed across 8 tasks with 7 completed:
- Average: ~450K tokens per task
- Task-008 is frontend UI implementation (components, utilities, responsive layout)
- Token usage consistent with complex React/TypeScript development
- Handoff document shows successful completion with all Definition of Done items met

No evidence of token waste or thrashing. Progress is linear and measurable.

### 6. Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Indicators:**
- Zero permission prompts (no dangerous operations)
- Only 3 files modified (well below 25 threshold)
- All changes are documentation (non-executable)
- No secrets or credentials committed
- Frontend implementation verified separately via filesystem inspection
- Handoff documents show clear task completion

**No High Risk Indicators:**
- No implementation drift
- No repeated failures
- No permission escalation attempts
- No excessive file churn

## Recommendation

**PROCEED WITHOUT HUMAN REVIEW**

Rationale:
1. Line count threshold breach is due to documentation expansion, not code bloat
2. Documentation changes are required deliverables for challenge scoring
3. Implementation progress is verified and consistent with plan
4. Zero security or permission concerns
5. Task-008 completion confirmed via handoff document
6. Ready to advance to task-009 (History charts with Recharts)

## Next Steps

1. Clear `runs/arbiter/pending.json`
2. Write `runs/arbiter/decision.json` with `needs_human: false`
3. Orchestrator should advance to task-009 or invoke lca-docs post-agent

## Notes

- This is the first arbiter checkpoint for run/001
- Time metric anomaly (29M minutes) appears to be a calculation error in the hook; does not affect decision
- Documentation quality is high and comprehensive
- No remediation required
